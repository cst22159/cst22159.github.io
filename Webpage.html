<h1> The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles Webpage </h1>
<p> This website talks about the ethics of autonomous vehicles, along with the relationship between safety and technology </p>
<h2> The Technology involved with autonomous vehicles: </h2>
<p> Autonomous vehicles have an array of technology inside of them. Non-autonomous vehicles have specfiic codes for certain things, but to the extent of a autonomous vehicle. Autonomous vehicles rely on specfic programs, algorithm, cameras, lidar, and many other parts to work properly. 
<br>
Autonomous vehicles rely on three key parts; radar, lidar, and cameras. These three elements work together to mimic the human ability to see and use the information. 
<br>
One element, being radar, has been in production for over two decades. Radar can be used for adaptive cruise control, emergency braking, lane keep assistance, and many other things. 
<br>
Another piece of technology implemented inside an autonomous vehicle (and new vehicles), is lidar. Lidar is laser technology, which helps to create 3-D maps of what’s going on around a vehicle. It works as a laser being shot out and is measured by the time it takes for it to come back to the sensor. The issue with lidar is how expensive it is and how the resolution/range works.

</p>
<p> Other exampels of technology include: </p>
<ul> 
		<li> Parking Assist. </li>
		<li> Sensing objects when parking </li>
		<li> Radar mapping for GPS. </li>
</ul>
<ol> 
		<li> Programmed in the form of 1's and 0's.  </li>
		<li> Communicated to the computer. </li>
		<li> The computer then works together with algorithm and code to preform an action </li>
	</ol>
<h2> The focus on technology and safety </h2>
<p> Many autonomous vehicle companies practice stright safety protocols for their vehicles. Some compaines dedicate more time and energy into these practices, with results in more safety and trust by the public. 
<br>
Over the past few years, artificial intelligence being used in vehicles is becoming more and more possible. Despite autonomous cars being seen more, there is a lack of trust in these vehicles. 
<br>
	In the USA, which statistics show half interviewed said they would not get into an autonomous vehicle. This distrust of technology can be stemmed back to an accident in America, where an Uber vehicle struck a passenger, since the technology did not recognize them as a passenger. People in the USA were also concerned with the amount of technology that keeps the drivers engaged on the road, since Tesla’s are not autonomous.

<h4> Pros of Autonomous Vehicles </h4>
<p>
There are studies that have shown that autonomous vehicles are safer than human driven ones. The primary reason this is, is because of human error. 
<br>
Humans are susceptible to making mistakes, being distracted, or not following laws. However, autonomous cars, which are programmed to do certain tasks, do not have nearly as many mistakes as human driven cars. <br>
Autonomous vehicles are more accurate, have faster reflexes, and have better vision. Self-driving vehicles also reduce traffic jams and can cut commute time. They also are better on gas and do less damage to the environment. </p>
<h4> Cons of Autonomous Vehicles </h4>
<p>
People believe Autonomous cars are not ethical. 
<br>
Some people believe that crashes among autonomous vehicles pose a tough question. Since these vehicles are learning based on algorithms, wouldn’t it already know the fate of its passenger? Would it be the algorithm’s fault for a crash, or if someone lost their life? 
<br>
Maybe it would be the company’s fault for coding the algorithm a certain way, which caused the accident. With autonomous vehicles, it would be difficult to find fault with accidents. And responsibility, people are worried about their security and privacy.
<br> 
Many people feel strongly about a piece of technology being able to choose if you live or die, all because of an algorithm. There is also an option in certain vehicles, for the amount of self-driving you can set the car at. People dislike this because it is people choosing how much they value their life and safety, and the responsibility on the vehicle.
